                <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
                <p>{COMPANY} doing business as <span>YourDomain.com</span> (“<span>YourDomain.com</span>” or “we” or “our”), owns and operates the website located at <span>YourDomain.com</span> (the “Site”). <span>YourDomain.com</span> provides and maintains this Site for your information, conditioned on your acceptance, without modification, of the terms, conditions and notices contained in these Terms of Use and in our Privacy Policy. By accessing and using the Site, you accept and agree without limitation to the following:</p>
                <h2>Products and Services</h2>
                <p><span>YourDomain.com</span> is not a lender and is not responsible for any lending product advertised or offered to you, or for any credit decisions made about you. No specific loan products are offered to you on this Site. Specific loan products are offered to you directly by the lender.</p>
                <h2>Esign Consent</h2>
                <p>You agree that clicking “Get Cash Now” (or other such button you use to submit your loan request) acts as your electronic signature. You further consent that we and any lender we share your request with can communicate with you electronically and that any required disclosures may be provided to you electronically, including without limitation any notices of adverse action that a lender is required send to you. You also confirm that you have the ability to access documents electronically, including the ability to view and save PDF files.</p>
                <h2>Loan Inquiry Policy</h2>
                <p><span>YourDomain.com</span> reserves the right to reject your inquiry at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. <span>YourDomain.com</span> may require additional information or verification before your loan request is accepted. When you submit your information through a form on our Site, you will be connected with a lender for further consideration based on the lender’s policies and procedures. This does not mean your loan has been approved. Loan approval is solely the lender’s decision. <span>YourDomain.com</span> is not responsible for taking, approving or denying your loan request. By submitting your information, you agree that if we cannot find a lender that can offer you the type of loan you initially requested, we will search our network of lenders and lending partners to see if we can find other lenders and lending partners with different loan products to help you.</p>
                <h2>Credit References</h2>
                <p>Participating lenders and lending partners may verify your social security number, driver’s license number or other federal or state identification, as well as review your credit worthiness through national databases that may include Equifax, Transunion, Experian and other credit bureaus. By submitting your information to us, you agree that lenders and lending partners may obtain such credit reports and verify your information.</p>
                <h2>Restrictions</h2>

If we become aware of any potential or suspected violation of these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy, we may (but are not obligated to) conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of the suspected violation and the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. During such investigation, we may suspend services to any customer being investigated and may delete data from our servers in order to prevent or minimize further violations. You agree to cooperate fully with any such investigation. You acknowledge that violating the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy could subject you to criminal or civil penalties.</p>
